# Cities Skylines 2 mod for Skipping the Opening Logo

## Requirements
- BepInEx 5.4.21

## Install
- install BepInEx 5.4.21 to you game root, run the game once then exit.
- download and unzip the Release zip file, put the dll file to yourgameroot\BepInEx\patchers folder. (not \plungins !)

## Compatibility
The mod uses BepInEx to prepatch , there is no mod conflict issue.
(The reason why the PDX mod method cannot be adopted is that the duration for reading the logo is hardcoded in the program, and the PDX can only run with a delay after the game has loaded.)
